## File list
### 1 Java features, grammars
- MyComparator.java    Try to override the default comparator for Collections.sort(List<T>, ? super T). Mainly override the compare(obj1, obj2) method. In this way, we can compare complicate structure, like nested lists [[], []].

### 4 Clean code demos
- GuessStatisticsMessage.java    Try to seperate the logic, to make functions and if statement easy to understand.
